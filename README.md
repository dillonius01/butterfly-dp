# react-template

Bootstrapped from a simple [React template](https://github.com/sjarman91/react-template) by DJ Shane

## Getting started
0. Make sure you have the latest version of `node` and `npm` installed globally.
1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependencies. If you have `yarn` installed globally, run `yarn`. Otherwise, `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`
4. Navigate to `localhost:3000` in your broswer!

For development, I suggest running two concurrent processes:
* `npm run dev` for the server
* `npm run build-watch` to compile webpack
